In this article, I discuss how The circular Economy can save both our economy and our environment

When you throw something away, where is ‘away’? There is no ‘away’! In our current economy, we take materials from the Earth, make products from them, and eventually throw them away as waste — the process is linear.

{ Take resources → make goods → waste } Economy

This can be traced back to the Industrial revolution where we started mass production of goods. All these goods needed to be sold to keep the system going and so we convinced ourselves that the goods that we have needed to keep on getting replaced with newer, fancier and better products constantly.

This system has allowed for goods to get increasingly cheaper and today, the poorest people are living lives several times more comfortable and wealthier than people did 50–100 years ago. Information is at the tip of our fingers and goods are continuously becoming cheaper and more accessible. So, what could be wrong?


Problems with linear Economy

It doesn’t make efficient use of resources (which aren’t infinite) — Cars are parked 92% of the time, 60% of office space in Europe remains unused even during work days
It is incredibly wasteful — we throw away ⅓ of all the food we make, 8 million tonnes of plastic enter the ocean each year
Resources are getting harder and more expensive to exploit
People are becoming aware of this but common responses are beach cleaning, using less, banning plastics and recycling. This, however, is treating the symptoms rather than the root cause. Besides, we only collect 14% of plastic material for recycling and of this only 2% is recycled in a closed loop fashion. This is because recycling is sometimes way more expensive and labour intensive than just making more plastic. Plastics actually has its origin in the fossil fuel industry and it was one of the products that was mass produced during WW2.

What is the Circular Economy
A circular Economy is an economic model of production and consumption where resources, raw materials and products are kept at their highest level of value and utility for as long as possible through sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing materials and products as long as possible. It seeks to eliminate waste and pollution beginning at the product design stage, circulate products and materials at their highest value for as long as possible and regenerate nature.

In a circular economy, we stop waste being produced in the first place. It calls on us to rethink product design, use and even ownership. What if we don’t own something and just license it from the manufacturer? It goes deeper than the 3Rs: Reuse, Reduce, Recycle. A circular economy is about getting the most value out of the resources that we have by keeping them at the highest utility and value.

Key Circular Economy concepts include 2 cycles (Biological & Technical), 3 Principles and a bunch of key words (Recycle, Collaborative Economy, Functional Economy, Reverse logistics, cascading, Eco-design, Waste Valorization,Remanufacture, …). Switching to green energy will only solve 55% of our Carbon Emissions. The rest is through how we make our products and grow our food.

Circular Economy Principles
The circular economy is based on three principles, driven by design:

Eliminate waste and pollution (Design out Waste & Pollution)
Circulate products and materials (at their highest value)- Keep products in use for as long as possible
Regenerate nature
i) Eliminate waste and pollution:

For many products on the market, there is no onward path after they are used. Take a crisp packet, for example. These multi-material flexible plastic packages cannot be reused, recycled or composted, so end up as waste. For products like these, waste is built in. They are designed to be disposable.

Although it sometimes seems like waste is inevitable in certain situations, waste is actually the result of design choices. There is no waste in nature, it is a concept we have introduced. From tiny, short-lived products, like crisp packets, all the way up to seemingly permanent structures like buildings and roads, the economy is filled with things that have been designed without asking: What happens to this at the end of its life?

By shifting our mindset, we can treat waste as a design flaw. In a circular economy, a specification for any design is that the materials re-enter the economy at the end of their use. By doing this, we take the linear take-make-waste system and make it circular.

Eco-design means the integration of environmental aspects at all stages of a product’s life cycle (from manufacturing, distribution and use to final recovery)

Many products could be circulated by being maintained, shared, reused, repaired, refurbished, remanufactured, and, as a last resort, recycled. Food and other biological materials that are safe to return to nature can regenerate the land, fuelling the production of new food and materials.

With a focus on design, we can eliminate the concept of waste

ii) Circulate products and materials (at their highest value)

The second principle of the circular economy is to circulate products and materials at their highest value. This means keeping materials in use, either as a product or, when that can no longer be used, as components or raw materials. This way, nothing becomes waste and the intrinsic value of products and materials are retained. This could include business models based on sharing, so users get access to a product rather than owning it and more people get to use it over time. It could involve reuse through resale. It could mean cycles of maintenance, repair, and refurbishment.

Reuse by:

Sign partnerships with NGOs to give another life to the materials you do not need anymore (like computers…) or to the product in a good shape that you cannot sell (like food…).
Extend product life by repairing materials.
Encourage customers to repair the product by providing repair services or repair workshops.
iii) Regenerate nature

By shifting our economy from linear to circular, we shift the focus from extraction to regeneration. Instead of continuously degrading nature, we build natural capital. We employ farming practices that allow nature to rebuild soils and increase biodiversity, and return biological materials to the earth. Currently, most of these materials are lost after use and the land used to grow them is depleted of nutrients.

Waste Valorization (the process of reusing, recycling or composting waste materials and converting them into more useful products including materials, chemicals, fuels or other sources of energy) is achieved by:

Transform food waste into compost.
Segregate and collect materials to help the recycling.
Use renewable energy and bio-based or fully recyclable inputs.
Resource recovery: Recover useful resources out of materials, by-products, or waste.
Use bioenergy, bio-based materials, biocatalysts, hydroponics and aeroponics resources.

Transitioning to renewable energy alone will only tackle 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The rest comes from the way we make and use products and food, and manage land — this is where the circular economy comes in. These regenerative food production practices include agroecology, conservation agriculture, and agroforestry (growing trees around or among crops or pasture). The economic, health, and environmental benefits of a circular economy for food alone would be worth USD 2.7 trillion a year by 2050. By adopting circular economy principles, the food industry could halve its projected greenhouse gas emissions in 2050.

The technical & biological cycles
Our natural environment is made up of two types of materials: Biodegradable and non-biodegradable. These give rise to the biological (on the left) and technical (on the right) cycles respectively, as shown in the Butterfly diagram below.

The Technical Cycle

Become a member
It is made up of materials that don’t biodegrade so metals, plastics, polymers (things that you’d want to recover in a circular economy and feed them back into the system through chemical/physical recycling). The processes that help us to get maximum value out of these materials include:

Maintenance
Reuse/Redistribution
Refurbishment/Remanufacture
Recycling
If designers thought about how their product could fit into the technical or biological cycles after use, that product could be made with that onward path in mind. For example, products destined for technical cycles would benefit from being easy to repair and maintain, easy to take apart, and made of modular components that can be replaced. They could be durable enough to withstand the wear and tear of many users. And they could be made from materials that are easily recycled. We need to redesign products so that valuable metals, alloys and polymers can maintain their quality and continue to be useful beyond the shelf-life of individual products.

Speaking of design, it is at this stage of manufacturing that we can rethink the life cycle of the products we are making. Think of a phone for a moment, it’s very possible to recycle 80–100% of the materials that make up a phone but the value won’t be the same. In Recycling the value of the product itself is lost but the value of the materials isn’t. The value was in the phone so making a long lasting phone is better than making a better phone-recycling system. Thus, recycling is a last resort kind of effort.

When it comes to remanufacturing, think of car engines. A car engine remade from a broken car engine has 80% less energy than the original engine. In this perspective, it would be thus better to re-engineer the production of engines for remanufacture or shelf-life rather than recycling. This would ensure there is more energy from engines that have been manufactured from broken ones since you would be changing much less parts and these would be engineered to be easily compatible. This would save so much money and resources.

Cars spend most of the time parked (like 90% of the time) thus it might seem like a waste or even a loss to own one. Even when it is being used it has only got one or 2 people a majority of the time. It would thus make more sense to turn it into a service that one can access (ridesharing, leasing) rather than a product that one can own. This would reduce congestion, it would improve the efficiency of the entire transport system, enable those who can’t afford a car but can afford a ride to access the service. This could end up influencing how cars are manufactured to begin with e.g., car manufacturers will start seeing car sales drop as less people will want to own cars & therefore they will start to design cars that can be remanufactured & reassembled so that they can get maximum value out of them in their whole life cycle.

Repair & maintenance keeps things in use at their highest original level for as long as possible. It fixes things so that they do not need to be recycled or remanufactured. Some may want to repair their own stuff while others may not & these are ideas for designers & product managers to explore more of. Sharing does just need to be with people you know. It is mostly for things that we might own but rarely use. The sharing economy prioritizes performance & access rather than ownership of a resource that you’ll barely use.

People don’t simply buy products or services; they “hire” them to make progress in specific circumstances. We call this progress their “Job to Be Done,” and understanding this opens a world of innovation possibilities.

Ridesharing is a common example but also consider something like a drill, most people have one, they rarely use it & yet it is something that will break down after only a few uses because it is probably on the lower end of the market (rarely would one buy an expensive power drill). In this example, you could have great quality power drills as a service that is shared when one needs it. In essence, sharing doesn’t need to be with people that you know, it can be done in a much more sophisticated manner. A higher level of this would be the example of Uber, AirBnB and even cloth/closet sharing that’s happening in China. The gig economy falls here in that you do not need to employ (a product) someone fully (owning them for 40 hours a week); You can hire them when you need to get something done (a service).

Recycling is the action or process of converting waste into reusable material. Recycling begins at the end — the ‘get rid’ stage of a product’s lifecycle. The circular economy, however, goes right back to the beginning to prevent waste and pollution from being created in the first place. In the face of our current environmental challenges, recycling won’t be enough to overcome the sheer amount of waste we produce. No item can be 100% recycled. Even aluminum with 90% recyclability still loses 10% each time it is recycled. Thus, recycling only slows down the loss of value. Recycling is what you might call ‘end-of-pipe’, while a circular economy’s ‘upstream’ solutions address potential problems right at the source. While recycling is undoubtedly a necessary component, we need to ensure that products and materials are designed, from the outset, to be reused, repaired, and remanufactured. It’s the consequences of decisions made at the design stage that determine around 80% of environmental impacts.

The Biological Cycle

Biological cycle is made up of biodegradable materials (food, wood, cotton). Biodegradable products such as food & wood-based products can be cycled in biological cycles. Normally these materials would return to the environment naturally after use but today this cycle is being interfered with in the way the design stage of materials is being handled e.g., by combining technical & biological materials in manners that make it difficult to recover either e.g., in polycotton clothes.

Further value can be created by cascading them for additional applications in different value streams. Cascading comes in handy here where a wood can be made into a table (maintained for long because it has a purpose) then at the end of its life as a table it can be used to make a particle board/panel and finally it can go down as compost if it is intelligently designed from the onset.

In a bio-refinery, conversion processes can produce high value chemicals and fuels.

Organic material that can’t be used further can be composted/anaerobically digested to extract valuable nutrients such as Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium & micro-nutrients.

The concept is to use materials for as long as possible. Think of a cotton cloth. With intelligent design during manufacture, it could serve as padding or sound-insulation then finally if it’s non-toxic, organic & biodegradable, it could feed back into that biological system by decomposition/compost. If you use toxic/non-biodegradable dye on it, however, you break the cycle & it can thus only be linear. The same goes for if you write using non-biodegradable ink on paper. The paper cannot be recycled into a cereal box, for example.

Regenerative mindset comes into play here when we try to make it all come full circle instead of only being consumptive and exploitive. If products like wooden furniture were designed — as well as to be easy to maintain and repair — with the biological cycle in mind, their biodegradable materials (like wood) would be easily separated from their technical materials (like screws) and if glues and paints were used they would be biodegradable. Other products, like takeaway food containers, can be designed to be compostable after one use so that they increase the chances of the food scraps they contain returning to the soil.

In order for products to successfully be circulated in either the biological or the technical cycle, it is essential they have been designed with their eventual circulation in mind. There are many products in our current economy that cannot be circulated in either cycle and end up as waste. There are products that fuse technical and biological materials in such a way that we can’t separate them and circulate them — for example, textiles that blend natural and plastic fibres.

Sharing Economy (Collaborative Economy) — Collaborative economy means connecting product users to one another and encouraging shared use, access, or ownership to increase product use. Examples include ridesharing services such as Lyft and Uber
Service, not Products (Economy of Functionality) — Includes laundromats. The main difference between between a sharing economy (platform) and an economy of functionality is that in an economy of functionality there is centralization of ownership (mostly a single company) of the product being provided as a service whereas in a collaborative economy the company is just a platform to coordinate access to the resources but does not necessarily own them.
Resource Recovery and Recycling (Remanufacture & reverse logistics) — Reverse logistics refers to the activities that a company engages in in order to have their product returned to them at the end of its life cycle
Product Life extension — This is incorporated at the product design stage for longer shelf life as well as ease of repair
Circular Supplies — The manufacture of biodegradable plastics as well as materials that are easy to remanufacture and recycle

Circular Economy Business Model Tenets
Circular sourcing — Sourcing recycled or renewable materials that can be returned to either the technical or biological cycle.
Co-product recovery — Residual/Secondary outputs from one process (or value chain) become inputs for another process (or value chain).
Re-make — Manufacturing steps acting on an end-of-life cycle part or product to return it to like-new or better performance, with warranty to match.
Re-condition — Fixing of a fault/aesthetic improvement of a product, but with no new/additional warranty on the product. Includes repair and refurbishment.
Performance — Focus on guaranteed performance level or outcome based on the functionality of a product/asset. Typically provided as a product-service bundle.
Access/Economy of Functionality — Providing end-users with access to the functionality of products/assets instead of ownership.
Resource recovery/Reverse Logistics — Materials or products at end-of-cycle are incorporated into different products or used as feedstock/inputs for another process (or value chain).

The Circular Economy has lots of benefits, not just for the environment but for society as well. Concepts such as the Collaborative economy allow middle to low-income households to access services that they were previously not consuming. In this way they create a market out of them. This is not the only way the circular economy coalesces with market creating innovation. The concept of jobs to be done is also ingrained into the service, not product model of the functional economy that is a segment of the circular economy. Although the concept of circular economy may appeal more to entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs should also be involved.
