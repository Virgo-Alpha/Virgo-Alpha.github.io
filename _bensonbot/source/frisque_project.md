AI-Powered Due Diligence Platform
Frisque is an agentic AI system designed to revolutionize the venture capital due diligence process. It automates and augments critical research, culminating in comprehensive investment memos and actionable insights. Frisque comes from the French words Faux Risque meaning false risk, which is what we aim to eliminate in the due diligence process.

Read more about Frisque in our blog post.

The Problem
Venture Capital (VC) firms dedicate a significant amount of time and resources to conducting due diligence on potential startup investments. This process is critical for assessing a startup's viability and growth potential, but it is incredibly time-intensive. Given that a fund's returns often come from a small percentage of its investments, streamlining this process is crucial for success.

Our Solution

Frisque is an AI-powered platform that significantly reduces the time and effort VCs spend on initial due diligence while improving the depth and breadth of insights. The platform uses a system of specialized AI agents that can:

Perform targeted research on a company based on inputs like pitch decks, financial documents, and founder profiles.
Analyze technology stacks, market trends, legal documents, and even social media sentiment.
Synthesize all findings into a structured investment memo and a summary dashboard.
Provide real-time updates and notifications on scan progress and completion.

Tech Stack
Frisque is built with a modern, scalable technology stack designed for asynchronous workloads and intelligent processing.

Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get the Frisque development environment up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
You must have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

Install Docker Engine
Install Docker Compose
Installation & Setup
Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Virgo-Alpha/frisque.git
cd frisque
Run the Application This single command will build the Docker images, create all the necessary services (web, database, broker, worker), and start the entire application stack.

docker-compose up --build
You will see logs from all the services in your terminal. Wait for the database to initialize and the web server to start.

Access the Application Once the services are running, open your web browser and navigate to: http://localhost:8000

You should see the default Django "Congratulations!" page. This confirms that the entire stack is working correctly!

Agents Configuration

Development Workflow
To ensure a consistent development environment, all commands should be run inside the web container using docker-compose exec.

How to Run Management Commands
Here are some examples of common manage.py commands.

Apply Database Migrations

docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
Create a Superuser

docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
Open a Django Shell

docker-compose exec web python manage.py shell
Enter a Bash Shell Inside the Container If you want an interactive shell inside the web container to look around:

docker-compose exec web bash
Testing the Application
Runtests while inside the application Inside the Container While inside the web container,you can run the command pytest

Runtests script While outside the web container, you can run the command:

./run_tests.sh
You can also run the full command below:

docker-compose exec web pytest
Stopping the Environment
To stop all running services, press Ctrl+C in the terminal where docker-compose up is running.

To stop the services and remove the containers (useful for a clean restart), run:

docker-compose down
