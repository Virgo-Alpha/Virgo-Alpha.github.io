title: "MCIs: How to save Africa & the rest of the 3rd World"

In this article, I discuss how Market creating innovations can save Africa and the world

There exists a prosperity Paradox that states that: Countries don’t create lasting prosperity by trying to solve acute signs of poverty. When money is flooded into poor systems and economies in an attempt to better the conditions for the populace, it ends up getting mismanaged and having little, if any, impact. One often wonders if Africa and the rest of the third world are, thus, doomed to an ill cycle of poverty, corruption, ignorance and disease. I mean, for us to have strong institutions we need credible leaders, and yet credible leaders are made by having strong institutions?

There is a way out of this seemingly endless cycle and, funny enough, it’s not through politics. It’s through Market Creating Innovations.

What are MCIs and How do they Work?
Innovation is a change in the process by which an organization transforms inputs of lower value into products and services of greater value. It is a new-to-the world idea in the technical, market, or business model domain.

According to the Clayton Christensen Institute, in terms of economic value there are three types of innovation:

Sustaining innovations — improvements made to existing solutions on the market and are typically targeted at customers who require better performance from a product or service
Efficiency innovations — enable companies to do more with fewer resources
Market Creating innovations — serves non-consumers

Market-creating innovations transform complicated and expensive products into products that are simple and affordable so that many more people are able to buy and use them.

In a sense, market creating innovations democratize previously exclusive products and services and, in many cases, they even create entirely new product categories.

Impact of MCIs:

create profits or at least have the prospect of profit generation in the future
Creation of jobs
Trigger & reinforce an entrepreneurial culture in a certain industry segment leading to more innovation because of competition
MCI pulls in the needed resources, investment, infrastructure, institutions etc instead of the conventional pushing of the same into struggling economies.

Examples of MCIs:

Mobile telecom in Africa: the story of Celtel
Diabetes in Mexico: Javier Lozano
ChotuKool: the $69 fridge for rural India
Insurance Case Study: Richard Leftley
Identifying MCI Opportunities
The economy can be divided by:

income (high, middle, low) which are proxies for what people can afford, whether companies should invest, and what opportunities are available in certain regions
By innovation (consumption vs non-consumption)
The consumption economy is composed of consumers who have the income, time, and expertise to purchase and use existing products and services in the market. This economy is relatively easy to assess by conventional metrics, and it’s the part of the economy that economists, forecasters, and marketing managers often use to predict the growth of a product in a region. Conventional wisdom suggests that investors look for growth in the consumption economy. But the non-consumption economy provides a much more fertile ground for market-creating innovation opportunities.

Non-consumers: The segment of the population for whom there was always underlying demand for products and services, but no adequate solution on the market.

Techniques to identify MCI opportunities:

Identify common barriers to consumption (money, access, time, skill)
Look for workarounds (e.g., chamas where there are no banks)
Consider common aversions (built-in desire to avoid a painful/costly alternative)
Examine your own life experiences (products & services that you enjoy that aren’t available to many/things that you don’t enjoy that are shared experiences)
Evaluating the non-consumption market size
Select a few economies in which a product or service has widespread consumption.
Calculate the average percent of income spent on the solution in these economies (you can use GDP per capita as a proxy for income).
Approximate what a non-consumer in an emerging market can spend on the solution by multiplying the GDP per capita by the estimate calculated in step 2.
Estimate the number of non-consumers in the emerging market.
Multiply the estimate from step 3 by the estimate from step 4. The result is the approximate size of the non-consumption market
From this relatively simple calculation, we see that the market for non-consumption is vast. But even these numbers underestimate the non-consumption opportunity because we’ve assumed a similar percentage of income for both consumers in wealthy countries and non-consumers in emerging economies. In fact, after analysing expenditures in several sectors, we learn that even though the absolute amount non-consumers in emerging economies spend is smaller than what consumers in wealthy countries spend, emerging-market non-consumers often spend a greater percentage of their income on products and services. Respectively, emerging market consumers in upper-middle and low- and lower-middle income countries spend around 2.2 times and 7.6 times the percent of income spent by consumers in high-income countries. Not surprisingly, the more democratized a product is, the less of a percentage of income people spend on it.

Which product/service will people really buy?
At its core, the concept of Jobs to Be Done asserts that people don’t simply buy products. Instead, people hire products that help them make progress when they find themselves in a particular circumstance of struggle. As a result, successful innovations must consider the people, the progress they’re trying to make, and the circumstance of struggle in which people find themselves.

People don’t simply buy products or services; they “hire” them to make progress in specific circumstances. We call this progress their “Job to Be Done,” and understanding this opens a world of innovation possibilities

Levels in the architecture of a job:

Uncovering the job to be done (functional, social & emotional dimensions)
Determining which experiences (in purchase & use) are needed to solve the job
Deciding what (resources) & how (processes) to integrate
A customer’s decision on deciding to hire a product/service for a job depends on forces such as:

Push of the situation — how dire the problem/inconvenience is
Pull of your product — Desirability
Habits of the present — Inertia of comfortability/familiarity
Anxiety of the new solution — concerns of cost, learning new stuff, or just the unknown

Bussinessification of MCIs
It is not enough to come up with an MCI product/service. One must go the extra mile of creating a system (business) that ensures that the products/services can get to the intended consumer in a manner that is both timely and sustainable. In this regard, there are two types of ventures that emerge:

SMEs (also known as SMBs) — Small and medium Enterprises or Businesses that exist to serve local markets with traditional, well-understood business ideas but with limited competitive advantage
IDEs (also referred to as start-ups) — Innovation driven Enterprises that pursue large scale/global opportunities based on bringing to customers new innovations that have a clear competitive advantage and high growth potential (scalability).
Keep in mind that IDEs are dependent on scalability and innovation, not technology. Many startups have risen without a significant development in technology, simply because they utilized a new distinct combination of either technical, market or business model dynamics. Think of neobanks and the unbundling/rebundling that happens.

The sweet spot is when an IDE’s innovation is not just of any type but a market creating one. I call this an MCIDE (Market-Creating Innovation-driven Enterprise)

MCIDE (Market-Creating Innovation-driven Enterprise) is the sweet spot where an IDE’s innovation is not just of any type but a market creating one.

The advantages of IDEs are numerous and obvious, from the great revenue streams that can be created to the potential impact it can have on society (think of how everyone spends most of their time online nowadays). The downsides, however, also merit as much concern, if not more. For an SME entrepreneur to succeed, it will depend on his business acumen, his ability to execute his project, and prevailing local demand, but he does not confront the multifaceted set of technical, market, and business risks faced by IDE entrepreneurs that render the execution challenge for IDEs even more imposing.

These challenges that are associated with the formation of an IDE make it difficult to start one as an individual. Indeed, throughout history, very few start-ups have had a single founder. Most are started by teams. Think of Google, Apple, Microsoft, Uber, AirBnB, Stripe etc. You might have noticed that the number of co-founders (as we refer to them) range. In some cases, two might be enough. It is not as much the number as the skills that the co-founders bring to the table. These skills need to be complimentary. The 2 most important skills, which your team needs to have an abundance of are:

Selling — can involve both large scale retail and wholesale selling to consumers (better for extroverts) or even in HR recruitment and investor relations (better for introverts).
Building — can involve coding, UI/UX, project management, content creation, writing, singing, shooting, acting, etc.
If a single individual has these two, then they’re unstoppable. Though that’s one of the rarest occurrences in our world, and thus the need for teams early on. Skills are important but so is character. Aim to partner with people who are:

Smart — so that they can complement your skills and work in the right direction
Hardworking — they need high energy so as to get stuff done
Have high integrity — not just so that they don’t rip you off but also so that they do what they say (remember that ideas are a dime a dozen, execution is everything)
Now that you have assembled your team based on their skill sets and character, it’s time to come up with your theory of business. It consists of:

assumptions about the environment of the organization: society and its structure, the market, the customer, and technology.
assumptions about the specific mission of the organization
assumptions about the core competencies needed to accomplish the organization’s mission
A theory of business allows you to identify your assumptions so that as you execute your MCIDE business idea, you have a checklist to tick or cross appropriately. Click here to learn more on the theory of business.

Once you have built your product (or service) and are ready to sell it, you’ll need to price it appropriately. This is a headache to most entrepreneurs as they start off with too high or too low a price. How do you know what’s the best price to start off with? Well, there are many ways to figure this out but I, personally, consider the pricing thermometer the best. Instead of price skimming, which I honestly think is a rip off, the pricing thermometer allows you to set a price either based on the value or cost of your product.

Value-based pricing — As a rule of the thumb, try and make sure your product gives your consumers 10X the value they are paying for. The higher the difference between the price and value is, the higher the incentive to buy your product. This is the best way to use the thermometer (You’ll need to know the value first of course)
Cost based pricing — Where you manually set your margins for each product. The higher the difference between the cost and price is, the higher the incentive to sell your product and the stronger a sales team you need. Branding has a significant part to play here as Apple products have such high margins (sometimes called Apple tax) and yet they still have significant market share.
It might be risky to put a lot of investment into an idea not knowing if it will work. This is why the lean start-up method is recommended. You build an MVP (minimum viable product) that satisfies your assumptions, based on the MoSCoW analysis or other method, but one that is very basic and requires very few resources. After your assumptions are confirmed then you can move on to building the business since the product has a market. Keep in mind that just because you have confirmed the market likes your product does not mean that you’ll succeed. To do that you’ll still need to iterate towards product-market fit.

Here’s how Andreessen defines product/market fit: The customers are buying the product just as fast as you can make it — or usage is growing just as fast as you can add more servers. Money from customers is piling up in your company checking account. You’re hiring sales and customer support staff as fast as you can.

After pricing, you’ll need to come up with a business model for your venture. Keep in mind that a business model involves a revenue model but also more. A revenue model is how the business will make money. A business model is how the business creates, delivers and captures value. Think of Facebook: It’s revenue model is ad driven but its business model is content, connection and community driven. It only captures a fraction of the value it creates as very few community members will use or consume the ads. For a comprehensive list of business models, click here.

The three checkboxes of a business model are:

User desirability
Business viability
Technology feasibility
Product-market fit only tells you that your product will succeed but not your business. To figure that out, you’ll need to determine whether you are default alive or default dead. This is done by using unit economics (one customer). The following equation tells you that:

CLV — CAC

When you take the Customer Lifetime Value (Total amount of money the customer will give you for as long as they are your customers) and you take away the Customer Acquisition Cost (Total amount needed to turn a prospective customer into an actual customer), you should get:

A positive number — This means you are default alive and you only need to optimize your process to get higher margins
A negative number — This means you are default dead and you need to rethink your business model or pricing
If all the above steps are followed and or considered, then your venture should be one that is on its way to success while creating a significant positive impact on society. As a parting shot, I’ll leave you with the first and second runners up ideas on saving the third world. One was to educate women and the other was to feed kids. I hope you enjoyed reading and learnt at least one new thing.
