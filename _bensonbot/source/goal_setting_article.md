title: "Goal Setting & New Year Resolutions: A lesson in Systems Thinking"

In this article, I discuss how to set new goals for the year

“We do not rise to the level of our goals, we fall to the level of our systems.”

That explains a lot! It explains why we are back to the warmth of our beds after that first week of new year’s, contrary to our resolutions. It explains why you’re waking up in an unknown location on the second Sunday of the year after promising yourself this is the year you’d go clean.

Why do we do that to ourselves? Why do we set ambitious goals only to fall down face up and start admiring the stars we were once reaching for? Is life that meaningless or is luck that strong as to determine who succeeds and who doesn’t? What is life’s purpose anyway?

Now, now. Before you go down that rabbit hole of negative self degrading thoughts, here are a few things you should consider. First, was that goal really yours? Was it really you? Do you want a lean body for your long term health or just to flex with the lads and ladies? Second, did you set up the systems necessary for you to achieve your goals? Did you try sleeping early, cutting off friends that drink or even cooking to avoid the allure of junk food? Remember, we do not rise to the level of our goals, we fall to the level of our systems.

That being said, here are a couple of techniques that can help with consistency in pursuing your goals:

The 2-day rule: with whatever habit you’re trying to build, never allow yourself to skip more than one day in a row. Skipping one day won’t hurt your habit building, as long as you don’t skip the next one.
The 30-for-30 approach: do 30 minutes of the thing you are trying to improve at for 30 days in a row. 30 minutes per day is short enough that you can mentally take it on. 30 days of 30 minutes per day is 900 total minutes of accumulated effort. This will yield surprisingly significant results. There’s almost nothing in the world that you won’t improve at if you spend 900 minutes of focused, dedicated effort on it.
Minimum Viable Progress is the notion that you should not skip a day, but anything above zero counts. Remember the value of compound interest!
Habit Stacking — James Clear famously pointed out that we execute on Daily Systems most effectively when they are fixed to a time or action that makes them easy to structure and regiment. We call this a hook, a kind of trigger to get into the arena. Like vowing to do push ups every time you brush your teeth.
I have also included a couple of wise words from a friend below that might help you stick to (or not) your resolutions this year:

Don’t set them in stone. Be willing to pivot and change based on your circumstances. We grow everyday and the world changes every second. It is foolish to not be willing to change your mind when presented with new information, even if it is about your own goals. For a practical example, you could try saving your resolutions in an editable place such as in a notes app on your phone rather than manually writing them in a diary. This simple action could shift the way you view them entirely.
Break them down into smaller, more direct actions. Sometimes we fail to achieve our goals because we stated them as this big audacious goal and never bothered to think deeper as to what the road there might look like. After you think of a goal, think of why you want it first then think of a way to achieve it. The easiest way that I have found is to look at the components of what my goals is made up of and see what I need to achieve these
Be accountable. Once broken down, you should develop a mechanism to measure progress for each of your goals. You should set deadlines for both the main goal and its broken down components then set dates to check in. For finances, I simply use google sheet and log in personal financial statements at the end of the month. For the rest, I set calendar tasks on my Google calendar.
