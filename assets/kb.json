(If the term cherrypick still gives you nightmares from your adventures in gitland then here’s a fitbump 👊). Perhaps this is because of the high dimensionality of our data or just in the cyclic model hyperparameter finetuning. Regardless of the reason, learning the different ways you can employ to decide which features to use and which to not use can end up improving model performance or even reducing computational time and complexity. EDA, Cleaning and Preprocessing For this exercise, I employed the Financial Inclusion in Africa Competition in Zindi because of 2 reasons: Readily available data A starter notebook that deals with EDA and basic data cleaning As such, the very next step from these offerings in the competition is to do feature engineering.",

Consider running the example a few times and compare the average outcome. Code Block 3. Recursive Feature Elimination The Recursive Feature Elimination (or RFE) works by recursively removing attributes and building a model on those attributes that remain. It uses the model accuracy to identify which attributes (and combination of attributes) contribute the most to predicting the target attribute.

A property of PCA is that you can choose the number of dimensions or principal component in the transformed result. In the example below, we use PCA and select 3 principal components. Learn more about the PCA class in scikit-learn by reviewing the PCA API. Dive deeper into the math behind PCA on the Principal Component Analysis Wikipedia article. PCA Usefulness: Dimension reduction: When dealing with datasets containing a large number of features, PCA can help reduce the dimensionality while preserving most of the variability in the data.

Noise reduction: PCA identifies and removes redundant information (noise) in the data by focusing on the directions of maximum variance. This can lead to improved model performance by reducing overfitting and improving generalization Feature Creation: PCA can be used to create new composite features (principal components) that capture the most important information in the original features.

This can improve the stability and interpretability of regression models. Code Block 5. Correlation Matrix With HeatMap A correlation matrix is a square matrix that shows the correlation coefficients between pairs of variables in a dataset. Each cell in the matrix represents the correlation coefficient between two variables. The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, where: 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation, 0 indicates no correlation, and -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation.",

Darker colors (e.g., red) represent stronger positive correlations, while lighter colors (e.g., blue) represent stronger negative correlations. The diagonal of the heatmap typically shows correlation values of 1, as each variable is perfectly correlated with itself. By visualizing the correlation matrix as a heatmap, you can quickly identify patterns of correlation between features. In the heatmap, you can look for clusters of high correlation (e.g., dark squares) to identify groups of features that are highly correlated with each other. Once identified, you can decide whether to keep, remove, or transform these features based on their importance to the model and their contribution to multicollinearity.",

There are a multitude of ways to go about it but depending on your particular use case, be it supervised or unsupervised, some may be better than others. For instance, in supervised learning as was our case above, we compared the features against their usefulness in determining a target variable. However, in unsupervised learning, there is no target variable. As such, most feature selection algorithms that are useful here compare the variables to each other, helping cull out the ones with high multicollinearity.

In this case, terraform means developing a rock or dead planet that is inhabitable so that it can have the necessary conditions to be able to sustain life. Terraforming Mars would involve generating an atmosphere, introducing water sources, and fostering plant life to create conditions where humans could survive. Similarly, in the world of software development, HashiCorp’s Terraform follows the same principle—except instead of reshaping planets, it transforms cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, and vSphere, or on premise resources, into structured environments where applications can thrive.",

    "content": "In this article, I discuss Building “Sentinel”: multi-agent cybersecurity news triage and publishing system on AWS. TLDR; I built Sentinel, a serverless, agentic pipeline that turns noisy RSS feeds into actionable cybersecurity intel (dedup, triage, publish). Deterministic first, agentic later: Step Functions → Lambdas, then flipped a feature flag to Bedrock AgentCore (Strands) without changing contracts. Reliability by design: SQS buffering, DLQs, idempotency keys, guardrails, and graceful degradation (semantic → heuristic). Search that scales: OpenSearch Serverless with BM25 + vectors, cached embeddings, clusters for near-dupes. Secure & observable: Cognito + least privilege, KMS, WAF, VPC endpoints, JSON logs + X-Ray, SLOs & cost alarms.",

I wanted to be kept abreast of the latest happenings in the industry but I want to automatically share anything that may be relevant so that’s why I expanded my requirements. My solution Sentinel is an AWS-native, multi-agent cybersecurity news triage and publishing system that autonomously ingests, processes, and publishes cybersecurity intelligence from RSS feeds and news sources. The system reduces analyst workload by automatically deduplicating content, extracting relevant entities, and intelligently routing items for human review or auto-publication.",

The core remained a set of Lambda functions behind Step Functions, with EventBridge schedules kicking off ingestion. I routed all content through a buffered pipeline: EventBridge fanned into SQS so bursts of feeds didn’t cascade into failures, and every consumer Lambda processed messages idempotently using a canonical-URL SHA-256 as the key. I attached DLQs at each hop (EventBridge, SQS consumers, Step Functions tasks) and wrote compensation paths so partial successes (e.g., stored raw content but failed dedup) re-queued safely. My architecture I modeled storage deliberately. In DynamoDB I used a primary table for articles with GSIs for statepublished_at (queues and dashboards), cluster_idpublished_at (duplicates), and tagspublished_at (topic browsing).",

Step Functions called Lambdas (FeedParser → Relevancy → Dedup → Summarize → Guardrail → Decision), and a thin “agent shim” Lambda exposed the same interface I knew I’d use later. When I was ready, I deployed my Strands-defined Ingestor and Analyst Assistant agents to Bedrock AgentCore and flipped a feature flag so Step Functions invoked the agents instead.

I used LLM calls to score relevance to my taxonomy and extract entities (CVE IDs, threat actors, malware, vendors/products) with confidences and rationales.

Strands packages those definitions and deploys them to Bedrock AgentCore so they can run at scale with standardized tool I/O, built-in observability, and clean A2A (agent-to-agent) patterns.

Feature flags are product features: enable_agents, enable_opensearch, guardrail levels, and digests let you canary safely and roll back instantly.

In fact, after analysing expenditures in several sectors, we learn that even though the absolute amount non-consumers in emerging economies spend is smaller than what consumers in wealthy countries spend, emerging-market non-consumers often spend a greater percentage of their income on products and services. Respectively, emerging market consumers in upper-middle and low- and lower-middle income countries spend around 2.2 times and 7.6 times the percent of income spent by consumers in high-income countries.

You build an MVP (minimum viable product) that satisfies your assumptions, based on the MoSCoW analysis or other method, but one that is very basic and requires very few resources. After your assumptions are confirmed then you can move on to building the business since the product has a market.

For AI-assisted development, specs act as guardrails, ensuring that generated code remains consistent with the system’s design goals.

I then executed the tasks one by one and checked to ensure that the code generated met my standards and creative vision. Vibe coding Vibe coding is Kiro’s term for an exploratory, conversational style of development where developers work at the level of intent rather than syntax.

Agent hooks Agent hooks allow developers to attach AI agents to specific lifecycle events such as file changes, test failures, or deployment steps. These agents can observe state, reason about deltas, and take targeted actions,ranging from suggesting fixes to generating artifacts or alerts. Rather than operating as a monolithic assistant, Kiro’s agents are modular and event-driven, which makes them predictable and composable.

They serve as long-lived guidance for both humans and AI agents, shaping decisions without prescribing implementation details. In practice, steering docs help maintain coherence as a project grows, especially when multiple contributors or agents are involved. They are particularly valuable in AI-assisted environments, where consistent direction is necessary to avoid fragmentation and unintended complexity.

I believe it to be a pioneer piece of art in the market because of more than a few aspects of its production and marketing strategy.

They leveraged already created networks and relationships to make sure the film is shot within budget Lack of financing — The film was low budget, for as the director explained, they did not have a budget for marketing.",

They held billboards that advertise their film out into the streets. The billboards made ridiculous claims about what the film can do for you, which ranged from increasing sexual stamina for males to making husbands return home early.

I frequently struggle on where I can find Kenyan films without paying a subscription fee that I might never fully utilize. A centralized platform could solve issues of accessibility and could even contribute to the reduction in price of the film.

It’s weird to think that most of us think unoriginally or in a fake way. It’s even more peculiar to call anything original in our ever increasingly complex and interconnected world. We pick up on ideas and information, actively or passively, and some trickle down into our subconscious and may emerge again veiled as a flame of creative outburst. Therefore, some of the ideas, ideals and ethics that we credit to ourselves may have never been ours to begin with. Yet it is not entirely impossible, because nothing ever really is, to independently come up with a most common idea. In his book, Sapiens, Yuval Noah Harari states that agriculture may have begun independently along fertile river valleys all over the world from Mesopotamia to the Yellow river in China.

However, to succeed, you need to maintain a healthy disregard for the impossible. This is why you should hire and spend time with rational optimists. Like Thanos, you must make yourself inevitable. Build leverage and competitive advantage so much that you are impossible to compete with. Compound yourself by letting go of small linear opportunities. This can be done by moving from zero to one every time rather than one to n, which is just copying or adding unto what already exists in the world/market. You should have insanely great ideas in your startup that sound like you want to take over the world. Rather than succeed at something inconsequential, it is much better to fail at something awesome. Encourage doing impossible things. Impossible becomes the new normal quite quickly.",

The domain name system (DNS) brings the two together and gets you to your destination. DNS is, in simple words, the technology that translates human-adapted, text-based domain names to machine-adapted, numerical-based IP. Once you type the URL in the browser, the browser first checks if it knows that URL then it asks the computer’s OS. If the OS doesn’t know then it asks the resolver server (which is usually the Internet Service Provider).

This approach: Keeps your credentials separate from your code logic. Prevents accidental leaks in version control or shared scripts.

For example, have one file for all functions that interact with Google Sheets (sheets.gs), another for Gmail logic (gmail.gs), and a main file for the primary workflow (main.gs).

One Project vs. Multiple Projects The decision to keep code in one project or split it into different projects depends on the tasks you are automating. Keep it in one project if: The scripts are part of a single, cohesive workflow (e.g., reading from a Sheet, processing the data, and sending an email). The functions in different files need to call each other or share global variables. The entire workflow can operate under a single set of permissions (e.g., the whole project needs access to both Sheets and Gmail). Split it into multiple projects if: The automations are completely unrelated (e.g., one script organizes your Drive, and another sends you a daily weather report).

Limitations 1. Cannot Decrypt Password-Protected Files A script can see a password-protected file in Google Drive, but it cannot open or read its contents. The Apps Script environment has no built-in mechanism to supply a password to decrypt a file, which is why a more capable environment like a Python script or Google Cloud Function is required for this task. 2.

For long-running tasks like processing hundreds of files or spreadsheet rows, your script may time out before it can finish. 4. Service Quotas and Rate Limits To prevent abuse, Google imposes daily quotas and rate limits on the use of its services.

This dashboard can display key metrics such as total value bought and sold over time, monthly performance, and even stock-specific trends. By connecting your sheet directly to Looker Studio and visualizing your data through bar charts, line graphs, or scorecards, you gain a real-time, interactive view of your portfolio’s evolution. It’s a great way to stay informed and make data-driven investment decisions. The Apps script, however, cannot automate the making of the charts and so you will need to add, format and align them manually.

It explains why we are back to the warmth of our beds after that first week of new year’s, contrary to our resolutions. It explains why you’re waking up in an unknown location on the second Sunday of the year after promising yourself this is the year you’d go clean. Why do we do that to ourselves? Why do we set ambitious goals only to fall down face up and start admiring the stars we were once reaching for? Is life that meaningless or is luck that strong as to determine who succeeds and who doesn’t? What is life’s purpose anyway? Now, now. Before you go down that rabbit hole of negative self degrading thoughts, here are a few things you should consider. First, was that goal really yours? Was it really you?

Become a member That being said, here are a couple of techniques that can help with consistency in pursuing your goals: The 2-day rule: with whatever habit you’re trying to build, never allow yourself to skip more than one day in a row. Skipping one day won’t hurt your habit building, as long as you don’t skip the next one. The 30-for-30 approach: do 30 minutes of the thing you are trying to improve at for 30 days in a row. 30 minutes per day is short enough that you can mentally take it on. 30 days of 30 minutes per day is 900 total minutes of accumulated effort.

We call this a hook, a kind of trigger to get into the arena. Like vowing to do push ups every time you brush your teeth. I have also included a couple of wise words from a friend below that might help you stick to (or not) your resolutions this year: Don’t set them in stone.

Sometimes we fail to achieve our goals because we stated them as this big audacious goal and never bothered to think deeper as to what the road there might look like. After you think of a goal, think of why you want it first then think of a way to achieve it. The easiest way that I have found is to look at the components of what my goals is made up of and see what I need to achieve these Be accountable. Once broken down, you should develop a mechanism to measure progress for each of your goals. You should set deadlines for both the main goal and its broken down components then set dates to check in.

Precision in Prompting and Agent Tooling: A critical insight gained was that agents within ADK do not need explicit direction on which tools to use. Simply providing the prompt is sufficient, as ADK already exposes the available tools to the agent, and the agent's selection of tools is part of its inherent agency.

The difference between a loop and a cycle in this case is that in a loop, we know the starting and ending point. The loop ends based on whether a certain condition is met but a cycle has none. DAGs are run using tools / engines for orchestration like Apache Airflow, Luigi, Prefect, Dagster, Kestra, etc. Smaller workflows can be run using make and or cron jobs but this is usually done locally.

While automation focuses on individual tasks, orchestration ensures all those tasks are arranged and managed within a broader, cohesive system.

Data Modeling: Data modelling is the process of defining and organizing the structure of data within a system or database to ensure consistency, clarity, and usability. It involves creating abstract representations (models) of how data is stored, connected, and processed.

Partitioning splits a table into segments (partitions) based on the values of a specific column (usually date/time or integer range).

The same query processes less data for a partitioned table than for a non-partitioned table thus saving both time and money for queries that are frequently run. You can have a maximum of 4000 partitions in a table. Clustering, on the other hand, organizes rows within a partition (or unpartitioned table) based on the values in one or more columns. It enables fine-grained pruning of data during query execution and optimizes filter operations, joins and aggregations by organizing data on disk. You can specify up to 4 columns to cluster by; They must be top level and non-repeated fields. Big query performs automatic reclustering for newly added data at no cost.",

As such, use cases for streaming include fraud detection, hacked account detection and surge pricing (uber). Batch is best for use cases where data is generated in large volumes but not continuously and can be processed in intervals. You can even use micro batching (15 and 60 minute batches) in case you have a lot of data but not enough to justify streaming. Streaming uses a pub-sub model where publishers publish data and subscribers read and process this data. Data is transmitted in packets known as topics and each topic stores it’s own timestamp. The use cases for streaming in analytical data is low (which is the main data that data engineers mostly use).",

In terms of technology, Apache spark is used for batch processing, Apache Kafka is used for streaming and Apache Flink supports both batch and stream processing but it was built for stream processing. 8. Exposure: Visualization and Predictions In data engineering - especially in the context of modern data tooling like dbt - an exposure refers to the end-use or downstream dependency of data models that shows where and how the data is being used outside of the transformation layer.

Step 2: Parsing To parse means to segment a sentence into its constituent parts and describe their syntactic roles. In computing, parse is used in strings, texts and commands. This is the stage at which the computer will differentiate ls from -l and both of them from .c. Step 3: Checking for special characters like pipes It is at this stage that pipes and other special characters are checked. Pipes are a form of redirection of the output of one process to another process instead of the terminal window (STDOUT) for further processing.

In our current economy, we take materials from the Earth, make products from them, and eventually throw them away as waste — the process is linear. { Take resources → make goods → waste } Economy This can be traced back to the Industrial revolution where we started mass production of goods. All these goods needed to be sold to keep the system going and so we convinced ourselves that the goods that we have needed to keep on getting replaced with newer, fancier and better products constantly. This system has allowed for goods to get increasingly cheaper and today, the poorest people are living lives several times more comfortable and wealthier than people did 50–100 years ago. Information is at the tip of our fingers and goods are continuously becoming cheaper and more accessible. So, what could be wrong?",

It seeks to eliminate waste and pollution beginning at the product design stage, circulate products and materials at their highest value for as long as possible and regenerate nature. In a circular economy, we stop waste being produced in the first place. It calls on us to rethink product design, use and even ownership. What if we don’t own something and just license it from the manufacturer? It goes deeper than the 3Rs: Reuse, Reduce, Recycle. A circular economy is about getting the most value out of the resources that we have by keeping them at the highest utility and value.",

Circular Economy Principles The circular economy is based on three principles, driven by design: Eliminate waste and pollution (Design out Waste & Pollution) Circulate products and materials (at their highest value)- Keep products in use for as long as possible Regenerate nature i) Eliminate waste and pollution: For many products on the market, there is no onward path after they are used.

There is no waste in nature, it is a concept we have introduced. From tiny, short-lived products, like crisp packets, all the way up to seemingly permanent structures like buildings and roads, the economy is filled with things that have been designed without asking: What happens to this at the end of its life? By shifting our mindset, we can treat waste as a design flaw. In a circular economy, a specification for any design is that the materials re-enter the economy at the end of their use. By doing this, we take the linear take-make-waste system and make it circular. Eco-design means the integration of environmental aspects at all stages of a product’s life cycle (from manufacturing, distribution and use to final recovery) Many products could be circulated by being maintained, shared, reused, repaired, refurbished, remanufactured, and, as a last resort, recycled.",

This means keeping materials in use, either as a product or, when that can no longer be used, as components or raw materials. This way, nothing becomes waste and the intrinsic value of products and materials are retained. This could include business models based on sharing, so users get access to a product rather than owning it and more people get to use it over time. It could involve reuse through resale.

The value was in the phone so making a long lasting phone is better than making a better phone-recycling system. Thus, recycling is a last resort kind of effort. When it comes to remanufacturing, think of car engines. A car engine remade from a broken car engine has 80% less energy than the original engine. In this perspective, it would be thus better to re-engineer the production of engines for remanufacture or shelf-life rather than recycling.

This could end up influencing how cars are manufactured to begin with e.g., car manufacturers will start seeing car sales drop as less people will want to own cars & therefore they will start to design cars that can be remanufactured & reassembled so that they can get maximum value out of them in their whole life cycle.

Recycling is the action or process of converting waste into reusable material. Recycling begins at the end — the ‘get rid’ stage of a product’s lifecycle.

Cascading comes in handy here where a wood can be made into a table (maintained for long because it has a purpose) then at the end of its life as a table it can be used to make a particle board/panel and finally it can go down as compost if it is intelligently designed from the onset.
